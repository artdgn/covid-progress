# ## Top 20 by estimated need for ICU beds
# - ICU need is estimated as [6% of active cases](https://medium.com/@joschabach/flattening-the-curve-is-a-deadly-delusion-eea324fe9727).
# - ICU capacities are from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_hospital_beds) (OECD countries mostly) and [CCB capacities in Asia](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/338520008_Critical_Care_Bed_Capacity_in_Asian_Countries_and_Regions).
# - ICU spare capacity is based on 70% normal occupancy rate ([66% in US](https://www.sccm.org/Blog/March-2020/United-States-Resource-Availability-for-COVID-19), [75% OECD](https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/social-issues-migration-health/health-at-a-glance-2019_4dd50c09-en))
# - Details of estimation and prediction calculations are in [Appendix](#appendix).
# - Column definitions:
#     - **Estimated ICU need per 100k population**: number of ICU beds estimated to be needed per 100k population by COVID-19 patents.
#     - **Projected in 14 days**: projected ICU need per 100k population in 14 days.
#     - **Projected in 30 days**: projected ICU need per 100k population in 30 days.
#     - **ICU capacity per 100k**: number of ICU beds per 100k population.
#     - **Estimated ICU Spare capacity per 100k**: estimated ICU capacity per 100k population based on assumed normal occupancy rate of 70% and number of ICU beds (only for countries with ICU beds data).
#     - **Estimated daily case growth rate**: percentage daily change in total cases during last 5 days.
# > Tip: The <b><font color="b21e3e">red (need for ICU)</font></b>  and the <b><font color="3ab1d8">blue (ICU spare capacity)</font></b>  bars are on the same 0-10 scale, for easy visual comparison of columns.

# <a id='appendix'></a>
# ## Appendix
# - I'm not an epidemiologist. This is an attempt to understand what's happening, and what the future looks like if current trends remain unchanged.
# - Everything is approximated and depends heavily on underlying assumptions.
# - Total case estimation calculated from deaths by:
#     - Assuming that unbiased fatality rate is 1.5% (from heavily tested countries / the cruise ship data) and that it takes 8 days on average for a case to go from being confirmed positive (after incubation + testing lag) to death. This is the same figure used by ["Estimating The Infected Population From Deaths"](https://covid19dashboards.com/covid-infected/) in this repo.
#     - Testing bias: the actual lagged fatality rate is than divided by the 1.5% figure to estimate the testing bias in a country. The estimated testing bias then multiplies the reported case numbers to estimate the *true* case numbers (*=case numbers if testing coverage was as comprehensive as in the heavily tested countries*).
#     - The testing bias calculation is a high source of uncertainty in all these estimations and projections. Better source of testing bias (or just *true case* numbers), should make everything more accurate.
# - Projection is done using a simple [SIR model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology#The_SIR_model) with (see [examples](#examples)) combined with the approach in [Total Outstanding Cases](https://covid19dashboards.com/outstanding_cases/#Appendix:-Methodology-of-Predicting-Recovered-Cases):
#     - Growth rate calculated over the 5 past days. This is pessimistic - because it includes the testing rate growth rate as well, and is slow to react to both improvements in test coverage and "flattening" due to social isolation.
#     - Recovery probability being 1/20 (for 20 days to recover) where the rate estimated from [Total Outstanding Cases](https://covid19dashboards.com/outstanding_cases/#Appendix:-Methodology-of-Predicting-Recovered-Cases) is too high (on down-slopes).
# - ICU need is calculated as being [6% of active cases](https://medium.com/@joschabach/flattening-the-curve-is-a-deadly-delusion-eea324fe9727) where:
#     - Active cases are taken from the SIR model.
#     - This is both pessimistic - because real ICU rate may in reality be lower, due to testing biases, and especially in "younger" populations), and optimistic - because active cases which are on ICU take longer (so need the ICUs for longer).
#     - ICU capacities are from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_hospital_beds) (OECD countries mostly) and [CCB capacities in Asia](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/338520008_Critical_Care_Bed_Capacity_in_Asian_Countries_and_Regions).
#     - ICU spare capacity is based on 70% normal occupancy rate ([66% in US](https://www.sccm.org/Blog/March-2020/United-States-Resource-Availability-for-COVID-19), [75% OECD](https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/social-issues-migration-health/health-at-a-glance-2019_4dd50c09-en))
